	/**[[custom-serialization]]
	 * === Custom Serialization
	 *
	 * After internalizing the serialization routines, and IL-merging the Newtonsoft.Json package in 6.x, we are pleased to
	 * announce that the next stage of serialization improvements have been completed in 7.0.
	 *
	 * Both SimpleJson and Newtonsoft.Json have been completely removed and replaced with an implementation of Utf8Json, a fast
	 * serializer that works directly with UTF-8 binary.
	 *
	 * With the move to Utf8Json, we have removed some features that were available in the previous JSON libraries that have
	 * proven too onerous to carry forward at this stage.
	 *
	 * - JSON in the request is never indented, even if SerializationFormatting.Indented is specified. The serialization
	 * routines generated by Utf8Json never generate an IJsonFormatter<T> that will indent JSON, for performance reasons.
	 * We are considering options for exposing indented JSON for development and debugging purposes.
	 *
	 * - NEST types cannot be extended by inheritance. With NEST 6.x, additional properties can be included for a type by deriving from
	 * that type and annotating these new properties. With the current implementation of serialization with Utf8Json, this approach will not work.
	 *
	 * - Serializer uses Reflection.Emit. Utf8Json uses Reflection.Emit to generate efficient formatters for serializing types that it sees.
	 * Reflection.Emit is not supported on all platforms, for example, UWP, Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Android.
	 *
	 * - Elasticsearch.Net.DynamicResponse deserializes JSON arrays to List<object>. SimpleJson deserialized JSON arrays to object[],
	 * but Utf8Json deserializes them to List<object>. This change is preferred for allocation and performance reasons.
	 *
	 * - Utf8Json is much stricter when deserializing JSON object field names to C# POCO properties. With the internal Json.NET serializer
	 * in 6.x, JSON object field names would attempt to be matched with C# POCO property names first by an exact match, falling back to a
	 * case insensitive match. With Utf8Json in 7.x however, JSON object field names must match exactly the name configured for the
	 * C# POCO property name.

		 * ==== Injecting a new serializer
		 *
		 * You can inject a serializer that is isolated to only be called for the (de)serialization of `_source`, `_fields`, or
		 * wherever a user provided value is expected to be written and returned.
		 *
		 * Within NEST, we refer to this serializer as the `SourceSerializer`.
		 *
		 * Another serializer also exists within NEST known as the `RequestResponseSerializer`. This serializer is internal
		 * and is responsible for serializing the request and response types that are part of NEST.
		 *
		 * If `SourceSerializer` is left unconfigured, the internal `RequestResponseSerializer` is the `SourceSerializer` as well.
		 *
		 * Implementing `IElasticsearchSerializer` is technically enough to inject your own `SourceSerializer`
