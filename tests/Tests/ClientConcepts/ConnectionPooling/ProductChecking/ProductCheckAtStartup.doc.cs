		* == Product check at startup
		*
		* Since v7.14.0, the client performs a required product check before the first call.
		* This pre-flight product check allows the client to establish the version of Elasticsearch that it is communicating with.
		*
		* The product check generally requires a single additional HTTP request to be sent to the server as part of the request pipeline before
		* the first API call is sent. In most cases, this will succeed during the first API call that the client sends.
		* Once the product check succeeds, no further product check HTTP requests are sent for subsequent API calls.
