		<h2>Open Source Licenses</h2>
		 
		<p>Microsoft maintains two licenses that have been certified by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a> (OSI). Certification by the OSI means that developers can be confident that the licenses meet the terms of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd">Open Source Definition</a>. This page contains the text of those licenses; developers are free to use them as they wish within their works.</p>
