[[children-aggregation-usage]]
=== Children Aggregation Usage

A special single bucket aggregation that enables aggregating from buckets on parent document types to
buckets on child documents.

Be sure to read the Elasticsearch documentation on {ref_current}/search-aggregations-bucket-children-aggregation.html[Children Aggregation]

==== Fluent DSL example

[source,csharp]
----
a => a
.Children<CommitActivity>("name_of_child_agg", child => child
    .Aggregations(childAggs => childAggs
        .Average("average_per_child", avg => avg.Field(p => p.ConfidenceFactor))
        .Max("max_per_child", avg => avg.Field(p => p.ConfidenceFactor))
        .Min("min_per_child", avg => avg.Field(p => p.ConfidenceFactor))
    )
)
----

==== Object Initializer syntax example

[source,csharp]
----
new ChildrenAggregation("name_of_child_agg", typeof(CommitActivity))
{
    Aggregations =
        new AverageAggregation("average_per_child", "confidenceFactor")
        && new MaxAggregation("max_per_child", "confidenceFactor")
        && new MinAggregation("min_per_child", "confidenceFactor")
}
