[[writing-aggregations]]
=== Writing aggregations

NEST allows you to write your aggregations using

* a strict fluent DSL

* a verbatim object initializer syntax that maps verbatim to the Elasticsearch API

* a more terse object initializer aggregation DSL

Three different ways, yikes that's a lot to take in! Let's go over them one at a time and explain when you might
want to use each.

This is the json output for each example

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "aggs": {
    "name_of_child_agg": {
      "children": {
        "type": "commits"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "average_per_child": {
          "avg": {
            "field": "confidenceFactor"
          }
        },
        "max_per_child": {
          "max": {
            "field": "confidenceFactor"
          }
        },
        "min_per_child": {
          "min": {
            "field": "confidenceFactor"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----

[float]
=== Fluent DSL

The fluent lambda syntax is the most terse way to write aggregations.
It benefits from types that are carried over to sub aggregations

==== Fluent DSL example

[source,csharp]
----
s => s
.Aggregations(aggs => aggs
    .Children<CommitActivity>("name_of_child_agg", child => child
        .Aggregations(childAggs => childAggs
            .Average("average_per_child", avg => avg.Field(p => p.ConfidenceFactor))
            .Max("max_per_child", avg => avg.Field(p => p.ConfidenceFactor))
            .Min("min_per_child", avg => avg.Field(p => p.ConfidenceFactor))
        )
    )
)
----

[float]
=== Object Initializer syntax

The object initializer syntax (OIS) is a one-to-one mapping with how aggregations
have to be represented in the Elasticsearch API. While it has the benefit of being a one-to-one
mapping, being dictionary based in C# means it can grow verbose rather quickly.

Here are the same aggregations as expressed in the Fluent API above, with the dictionary-based
object initializer syntax

==== Object Initializer syntax example

[source,csharp]
----
new SearchRequest<Project>
{
    Aggregations = new AggregationDictionary
    {
        {
            "name_of_child_agg", new ChildrenAggregation("name_of_child_agg", typeof(CommitActivity))
            {
                Aggregations = new AggregationDictionary
                {
                    {"average_per_child", new AverageAggregation("average_per_child", "confidenceFactor")},
                    {"max_per_child", new MaxAggregation("max_per_child", "confidenceFactor")},
                    {"min_per_child", new MinAggregation("min_per_child", "confidenceFactor")},
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----

As you can see, the key in the dictionary is repeated as the name passed to the aggregation constructor.
This starts to get hard to read and a little error prone, wouldn't you agree?

There is a better way however...

[float]
=== Terse Object Initializer syntax

The Object Initializer syntax can be shortened dramatically by using `*Aggregation` types directly,
allowing you to forego the need to introduce intermediary dictionaries to represent the aggregation DSL.
In using these, it is also possible to combine multiple aggregations using the bitwise `&&` operator.

Compare the following example with the previous vanilla Object Initializer syntax

==== Object Initializer syntax example

[source,csharp]
----
new SearchRequest<Project>
{
    Aggregations = new ChildrenAggregation("name_of_child_agg", typeof(CommitActivity))
    {
        Aggregations =
            new AverageAggregation("average_per_child", Field<CommitActivity>(p => p.ConfidenceFactor))
            && new MaxAggregation("max_per_child", Field<CommitActivity>(p => p.ConfidenceFactor))
            && new MinAggregation("min_per_child", Field<CommitActivity>(p => p.ConfidenceFactor))
    }
}
----

Now that's much cleaner! Assigning an `*Aggregation` type directly to the `Aggregation` property
 on a search request works because there are implicit conversions within NEST to handle this for you.

[float]
=== Mixed usage of object initializer and fluent

Sometimes its useful to mix and match fluent and object initializer, the fluent Aggregations method therefore
also accepts `AggregationDictionary` directly.

==== Fluent DSL example

[source,csharp]
----
s => s
.Aggregations(new ChildrenAggregation("name_of_child_agg", typeof(CommitActivity))
{
    Aggregations =
        new AverageAggregation("average_per_child", Field<CommitActivity>(p => p.ConfidenceFactor))
        && new MaxAggregation("max_per_child", Field<CommitActivity>(p => p.ConfidenceFactor))
        && new MinAggregation("min_per_child", Field<CommitActivity>(p => p.ConfidenceFactor))
})
----

[float]
=== Binary operators off the same descriptor

For dynamic aggregation building using the fluent syntax,
it can be useful to abstract the construction to methods as much as possible.
You can use the binary operator `&&` on the same aggregation descriptor to compose the graph.
Each side of the binary operation can return null dynamically.

[source,csharp]
----
s => s
.Aggregations(aggs => aggs
    .Children<CommitActivity>("name_of_child_agg", child => child
        .Aggregations(Combine)
    )
)
----

[float]
=== Returning a different AggregationContainer in fluent syntax

All the fluent selector expects is an `IAggregationContainer` to be returned. You could abstract this to a
method returning `AggregationContainer` which is free to use the object initializer syntax
to compose that `AggregationContainer`.

[source,csharp]
----
s => s
.Aggregations(aggs => aggs
    .Children<CommitActivity>("name_of_child_agg", child => child
        .Aggregations(childAggs => Combine())
    )
)
----

[float]
=== Aggregating over a collection of aggregations

An advanced scenario may involve an existing collection of aggregation functions that should be set as aggregations
on the request. Using LINQ's `.Aggregate()` method, each function can be applied to the aggregation descriptor
(`childAggs` below) in turn, returning the descriptor after each function application.

[source,csharp]
----
var aggregations =
        new List<Func<AggregationContainerDescriptor<CommitActivity>, IAggregationContainer>> <1>
        {
            a => a.Average("average_per_child", avg => avg.Field(p => p.ConfidenceFactor)),
            a => a.Max("max_per_child", avg => avg.Field(p => p.ConfidenceFactor)),
            a => a.Min("min_per_child", avg => avg.Field(p => p.ConfidenceFactor))
        };

return s => s
        .Aggregations(aggs => aggs
            .Children<CommitActivity>("name_of_child_agg", child => child
                .Aggregations(childAggs =>
                        aggregations.Aggregate(childAggs, (acc, agg) =>
                        {
                            agg(acc);
                            return acc;
                        }) <2>
                )
            )
        );
----
<1> a list of aggregation functions to apply
<2> Using LINQ's `Aggregate()` function to accumulate/apply all of the aggregation functions

[[handling-aggregate-response]]
[float]
=== Handling responses

The `SearchResponse` exposes an `AggregateDictionary` which is specialized dictionary over `<string, IAggregate>` that also
exposes handy helper methods that automatically cast `IAggregate` to the expected aggregate response.

Let's see this in action:

[source,csharp]
----
a => a
.Children<CommitActivity>("name_of_child_agg", child => child
    .Aggregations(childAggs => childAggs
        .Average("average_per_child", avg => avg.Field(p => p.ConfidenceFactor))
        .Max("max_per_child", avg => avg.Field(p => p.ConfidenceFactor))
        .Min("min_per_child", avg => avg.Field(p => p.ConfidenceFactor))
    )
)
----

Now, using `.Aggregations`, we can easily get the `Children` aggregation response out and from that,
the `Average` and `Max` sub aggregations.

==== Handling Responses

[source,csharp]
----
response.ShouldBeValid();

var childAggregation = response.Aggregations.Children("name_of_child_agg");

var averagePerChild = childAggregation.Average("average_per_child");

averagePerChild.Should().NotBeNull(); <1>

var maxPerChild = childAggregation.Max("max_per_child");

maxPerChild.Should().NotBeNull(); <2>
----
<1> Do something with the average per child. Here we just assert it's not null
<2> Do something with the max per child. Here we just assert it's not null
