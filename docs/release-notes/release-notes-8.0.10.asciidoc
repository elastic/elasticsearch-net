- https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/pull/7549[#7549] Update to latest 
transport to ensure ActivitySource is static. (issue: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/issues/7540[#7540])

This avoids undue and potentially high volume allocations of `ActivitySource` across 
consuming applications and is therefore a recommended upgrade.
