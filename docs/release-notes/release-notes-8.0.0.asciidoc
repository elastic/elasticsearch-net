[[release-notes-8.0.0]]
== Release notes v8.0.0

[TIP]
--
Due to the extensive changes in the new {net-client}, we highly recommend 
reviewing this documentation in full, before proceeding with migration to v8.
--

After many months of work, eleven alphas, six betas and two release candidates, 
we are pleased to announce the GA release of the {net-client} v8.0.0.

The overall themes of this release have been based around redesigning the client 
for the future, standardizing serialization, performance improvements, codebase 
simplification, and code-generation. 

The following release notes explain the current state of the client, missing 
features, breaking changes and our rationale for some of the design choices we have introduced.

[discrete]
=== Version 8 is a refresh

[IMPORTANT]
--
It is important to highlight that v8 of the {net-client} represents 
a new start for the client design. It is important to review how this may affect 
your code and usage. 
--

Mature code becomes increasingly hard to maintain over time, and 
our ability to make timely releases has diminished as code complexity has increased. 
Major releases allow us to simplify and better align our language clients with 
each other in terms of design. Here, it is crucial to find the right balance 
between uniformity across programming languages and the idiomatic concerns of 
each language. For .NET, we will typically compare and contrast with https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-java[Java] and https://github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch[Go] 
to make sure that our approach is equivalent for each of these. We also take 
heavy inspiration from Microsoft framework design guidelines and the conventions 
of the wider .NET community.

[discrete]
==== New Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch NuGet package

We have shipped the new code-generated client as a 
https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch/[new NuGet package]
with a new root namespace, `Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch`. 
The new v8 client is built upon the foundations of the v7 `NEST` client, but there 
are changes. By shipping as a new package, the expectation is that migration can 
be managed with a phased approach.

While this is a new package, we have aligned the major version (v8.x.x) with the 
supported {es} server version to clearly indicate the client/server compatibility. 
The v8 client is designed to work with version 8 of {es}.

The v7 `NEST` client continues to be supported but will not gain new features or 
support for new {es} endpoints. It should be considered deprecated in favour of 
the new client.

[discrete]
==== Limited feature set

[CAUTION]
--
The 8.0.0 {net-client} does not have feature parity with the previous v7 `NEST` 
high-level client.
--

For the initial 8.0.0 release we have limited the features we are shipping. 
Over the course of the 8.x releases, we will reintroduce features. Therefore, 
if something is missing, it may not be permanently omitted. We will endeavour to communicate our plans as and when they become available.

If a feature you depend on is missing (and not explicitly documented below as a 
feature that we do not plan to reintroduce), please open https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/issues/new/choose[an issue] 
or comment on a relevant existing issue to highlight your need to us. This will 
help us prioritise our roadmap.

[discrete]
=== Code generation

Given the size of the Elasticsearch API surface today, it is no longer practical 
to maintain thousands of types (requests, responses, queries, aggregations, etc.) 
by hand. To ensure consistent, accurate and timely alignment between language 
clients and {es}, the 8.x clients, and many of the associated types are now 
automatically code-generated from a https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-specification[shared specification]. This is a common solution to maintaining alignment between 
client and server among SDKs and libraries, such as those for Azure, AWS and the 
Google Cloud Platform.

code-generation from a specification has inevitably led to some differences 
between the existing v7 `NEST` types and those available in the new v7 {net-client}. 
For the 8.0.0 release, we generate strictly from the specification, special 
casing a few areas to improve usability or to align with language idioms. 

The base type hierarchy for concepts such as `Properties`, `Aggregations` and 
`Queries` is no longer present in generated code, as these arbitrary groupings do 
not align with concrete concepts of the public server API. These considerations 
do not preclude adding syntactic sugar and usability enhancements to types in future 
releases on a case-by-case basis.

[discrete]
=== Elastic.Transport

The .NET client includes a transport layer responsible for abstracting HTTP 
concepts and to provide functionality such as our request pipeline. This 
supports round-robin load-balancing of requests to nodes, pinging failed 
nodes and sniffing the cluster for node roles.

In v7, this layer shipped as `Elasticsearch.Net` and was considered our low-level 
client which could be used to send and receive raw JSON bytes between the client 
and server.

As part of the work for 8.0.0, we have moved the transport layer out into 
a https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elastic.Transport[new dedicated package] and 
https://github.com/elastic/elastic-transport-net[repository], named 
`Elastic.Transport`. This supports reuse across future clients and allows 
consumers with extremely high-performance requirements to build upon this foundation.

[discrete]
=== System.Text.Json for serialization

The v7 `NEST` high-level client used an internalized and modified version of 
https://github.com/neuecc/Utf8Json[Utf8Json] for request and response 
serialization. This was introduced for its performance improvements 
over https://www.newtonsoft.com/json[Json.NET], the more common JSON framework at 
the time.

While Utf8Json provides good value, we have identified minor bugs and 
performance issues that have required maintenance over time. Some of these 
are hard to change without more significant effort. This library is no longer 
maintained, and any such changes cannot easily be contributed back to the 
original project.

With .NET Core 3.0, Microsoft shipped new https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/try-the-new-system-text-json-apis[System.Text.Json APIs] 
that are included in-the-box with current versions of .NET. We have adopted 
`System.Text.Json` for all serialization. Consumers can still define and register 
their own `Serializer` implementation for their document types should they prefer 
to use a different serialization library.

By adopting `System.Text.Json`, we now depend on a well-maintained and supported 
library from Microsoft. `System.Text.Json` is designed from the ground up to support 
the latest performance optimizations in .NET and, as a result, provides both fast and low-allocation serialization.

[discrete]
=== Mockability of ElasticsearchClient

Testing code is an important part of software development. We recommend 
that consumers prefer introducing an abstraction for their use of the {net-client} 
as the prefered way to decouple consuming code from client types and support unit 
testing. 

In order to support user testing scenarios, we have unsealed the `ElasticsearchClient` 
type and made its methods virtual. This supports mocking the type directly for unit 
testing. This is an improvement over the original `IElasticClient` interface from
`NEST` (v7) which only supported mocking of top-level client methods.

We have also introduced a `TestableResponseFactory` in `Elastic.Transport` to 
make it easier to create response instances with specific status codes and validity 
that can be used during unit testing.

These changes are in addition to our existing support for testing with an 
`InMemoryConnection`, virtualized clusters and with our 
https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net-abstractions/blob/master/src/Elastic.Elasticsearch.Managed[`Elastic.Elasticsearch.Managed`] library for integration 
testing against real {es} instances. We will introduce more documentation on testing methodologies in the near future.

[discrete]
=== Migrating to Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch

[WARNING]
--
The 8.0.0 release does not currently have full-feature parity with `NEST`. The 
client primary use case is for application developers communitating with {es}.
-- 

The 8.0.0 release focuses on core endpoints, more specifically for common CRUD 
scenarios. We intend to reduce the feature gap in subsequent versions. We anticipate 
that this initial release will best suit new applications and may not yet be migration-ready for all existing consumers. We recommend reviewing this documentation carefully to learn about the missing features and reduced API surface details before migrating from the v7 `NEST` client.

The choice to code-generate a new evolution of the {net-client} introduces some 
significant breaking changes. We consciously took the opportunity to refactor 
and reconsider historic design choices as part of this major release, intending 
to limit future breaking changes.

The v8 client is shipped as a new https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch/[NuGet package] 
which can be installed alongside v7 `NEST`. We  
anticipate that some consumers may prefer a phased migration with both 
packages side-by-side for a short period of time to manage complex migrations. In addition, `NEST` 7.17.x can continue to be used in 
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/net-api/7.17/connecting-to-elasticsearch-v8.html[compatibility mode] 
with {es} 8.x servers until the v8 {net-client} features 
align with application requirements.

We will continue to prioritize the feature roadmap and code-generation work 
based on https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/issues[feedback] from consumers who may rely on features that are initially unavailable.

[discrete]
=== Breaking Changes

[WARNING]
--
As a result of code-generating a majority of the client types, this version of 
the client includes multiple breaking changes.
--

We have strived to keep the core foundation reasonably similar, but types emitted 
through code-generation are subject to change between `NEST` (v7) and the new 
`Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch` (v8) package.

[discrete]
==== Namespaces

We have renamed the package and top-level namespace for the v8 client to 
`Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch`. All types belong to this namespace. When 
necessary, to avoid potential conflicts, types are generated into suitable 
sub-namespaces based on the https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-specification[{es} specification]. Additional `using` directives may be required to access such types 
when using the {net-client}.

Transport layer concepts have moved to the new `Elastic.Transport` NuGet package 
and related types are defined under its namespace. Some configuration and low-level transport functionality may require a `using` directive for the `Elastic.Transport` 
namespace.

[discrete]
==== Type names

Type names may have changed from previous versions. We are not listing these 
explicitly due to the potentially vast number of subtle differences. 
Type names will now more closely align to those used in the JSON and as documented 
in the {es} documentation.

[discrete]
==== Class members

Types may include renamed properties based on the {es} specification, 
which differ from the original `NEST` property names. The types used for properties 
may also have changed due to code-generation. If you identify missing or 
incorrectly-typed properties, please open https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/issues/new/choose[an issue] to alert us.

[discrete]
==== Sealing classes

Opinions on "sealing by default" within the .NET ecosystem tend to be quite 
polarized. Microsoft seal all internal types for potential performance gains 
and we see a benefit in starting with that approach for the {net-client}, 
even for our public API surface. 

While it prevents inheritance and, therefore, may inhibit a few consumer scenarios, 
sealing by default is intended to avoid the unexpected or invalid 
extension of types that could inadvertently be broken in the future. That said, 
sealing is not necessarily a final choice for all types; but it is clearly 
easier for a future release to unseal a previously-sealed class than 
vice versa. We can therefore choose to unseal as valid scenarios arise, 
should we determine that doing so is the best solution for those scenarios, such 
as with mockability of the `ElasticsearchClient`. This goes back to our clean-slate concept for this new client.

[discrete]
==== Removed features

As part of the clean-slate redesign of the new client, we have opted to remove 
certain features from the v8.0 client. These are listed below:

[discrete]
===== Attribute mappings

In previous versions of the `NEST` client, attributes could be used to configure 
the mapping behaviour and inference for user types. We have removed support for
these attributes and recommend that mapping be completed via the fluent API when 
configuring client instances. `System.Text.Json` attributes may be used to rename 
and ignore properties during source serialization.

[discrete]
===== CAT APIs

The https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cat.html[CAT APIs] 
of {es} are intended for human-readable usage and will no longer be supported 
via the v8 {net-client}.

[discrete]
===== Interface removal

We have removed several interfaces that previously shipped as part of `NEST`. This 
is a design decision to simplify the library and avoid interfaces where only a 
single implementation of that interface is expected to exist, such as 
`IElasticClient` in `NEST`. We have also switched to prefer abstract base classes 
over interfaces across the library, as this allows us to add enhancements more 
easily without introducing breaking changes for derived types.

[discrete]
==== Missing features

While not an exhaustive list, the following are some of the main features which 
have not been re-implemented for this initial 8.0.0 GA release. 
These remain on our roadmap and will be reviewed and prioritized for inclusion in
future releases.

* Query DSL operators for combining queries.
* Scroll Helper.
* Fluent API for union types.
* `AutoMap` for field datatype inference.
* Visitor pattern support for types such as `Properties`.
* Support for `JoinField` which affects `ChildrenAggregation`.
* Conditionless queries.
* DiagnosticSources have been removed in `Elastic.Transport` to provide a clean-slate
for an improved diagnostics story. The {net-client} emits https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] compatible `Activity` spans which can be consumed by APM agents such as the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/dotnet/current/index.html[Elastic APM Agent for .NET]. 
* Documentation is a work in progress, and we will expand on the documented scenarios
in future releases.

[discrete]
=== Reduced API surface

In this first release of the code-generated .NET client, we have specifically 
focused on supporting commonly used endpoints. We have also skipped specific 
queries and aggregations which need further work to generate code correctly. 
Before migrating, please refer to the lists below for the endpoints, 
queries and aggregations currently generated and available 
in the 8.0.0 GA release to ensure that the features you are using are currently 
supported.
