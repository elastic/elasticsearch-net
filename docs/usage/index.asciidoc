== Using the .NET Client

The sections below provide tutorials on the most frequently used and some less obvious features of {es}.

For a full reference, see the {ref-current}/[Elasticsearch documentation] and in particular the {ref-current}/rest-apis.html[REST APIs] section. The {net-client} follows closely the JSON structures described there.

If you're new to {es}, make sure also to read {ref-current}/getting-started.html[Elasticsearch's quick start] that provides a good introduction.
