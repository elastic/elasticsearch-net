Sticky Connection Pool
Each connection pool returns the first `live` node so that it is sticky between requests

[source,csharp]
----
var numberOfNodes = 10;
var uris = Enumerable.Range(9200, numberOfNodes).Select(p => new Uri("http://localhost:" + p));
var pool = new StickyConnectionPool(uris);
----

Here we have setup a sticky connection pool seeded with 10 nodes.
So what order we expect? Imagine the following:

Thread A calls `.CreateView()` and gets returned the first live node
Thread B calls `.CreateView()` and gets returned the same node, since the first
node is still good

[source,csharp]
----
var startingPositions = Enumerable.Range(0, numberOfNodes)
    .Select(i => pool.CreateView().First())
    .Select(n => n.Uri.Port)
    .ToList();

var expectedOrder = Enumerable.Repeat(9200, numberOfNodes);
startingPositions.Should().ContainInOrder(expectedOrder);
