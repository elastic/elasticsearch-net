[[date-time-providers]]
== Date time providers

Not typically something you'll have to pass to the client but all calls to `System.DateTime.UtcNow`
in the client have been abstracted by `IDateTimeProvider`. This allows us to unit test timeouts and cluster failover
without being bound to wall clock time as calculated by using `System.DateTime.UtcNow` directly.

[source,csharp]
----
var dateTimeProvider = DateTimeProvider.Default;
----

dates are always returned in UTC 

[source,csharp]
----
dateTimeProvider.Now().Should().BeCloseTo(DateTime.UtcNow);
----

Another responsibility of this interface is to calculate the time a node has to be taken out of rotation
based on the number of attempts to revive it. For very advanced use cases, this might be something of interest
to provide a custom implementation for.

[source,csharp]
----
var dateTimeProvider = DateTimeProvider.Default;
----

The default timeout calculation is: `min(timeout * 2 ^ (attempts * 0.5 -1), maxTimeout)`, where the
default values for `timeout` and `maxTimeout` are

[source,csharp]
----
var timeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1);

var maxTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);
----

Plotting these defaults looks as followed:

[[timeout]]
.Default formula, x-axis number of attempts to revive, y-axis time in minutes
image::timeoutplot.png[dead timeout]

The goal here is that whenever a node is resurrected and is found to still be offline, we send it_back to the doghouse_ for an ever increasingly long period, until we hit a bounded maximum.

[source,csharp]
----
var timeouts = Enumerable.Range(0, 30)
    .Select(attempt => dateTimeProvider.DeadTime(attempt, timeout, maxTimeout))
    .ToList();

foreach (var increasedTimeout in timeouts.Take(10))
    increasedTimeout.Should().BeWithin(maxTimeout);
