=== Extending NEST types

Sometimes you might want to provide a custom implementation of a type, perhaps to work around an issue or because
you're using a third-party plugin that extends the features of Elasticsearch, and NEST does not provide support out of the box.

NEST allows extending its types in some scenarios, discussed here.

==== Creating your own property mapping

As an example, let's imagine we're using a third party plugin that provides support for additional data type
for field mapping. We can implement a custom `IProperty` implementation so that we can use the field mapping
type with NEST.

[source,csharp]
----
public class MyPluginProperty : IProperty
{
    IDictionary<string, object> IProperty.LocalMetadata { get; set; }
    IDictionary<string, string> IProperty.Meta { get; set; }
    public string Type { get; set; } = "my_plugin_property";
    public PropertyName Name { get; set; }

    public MyPluginProperty(string name, string language)
    {
        this.Name = name;
        this.Language = language;
        this.Numeric = true;
    }

    [PropertyName("language")]
    public string Language { get; set; }

    [PropertyName("numeric")]
    public bool Numeric { get; set; }
}
----

`PropertyNameAttribute` can be used to mark properties that should be serialized. Without this attribute,
NEST won't pick up the property for serialization.

Now that we have our own `IProperty` implementation we can add it to our properties mapping when creating an index

[source,csharp]
----
var createIndexResponse = client.Indices.Create("myindex", c => c
    .Map<Project>(m => m
        .Properties(props => props
            .Custom(new MyPluginProperty("fieldName", "dutch"))
        )
    )
);
----

which will serialize to the following JSON request

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "fieldName": {
        "type": "my_plugin_property",
        "language": "dutch",
        "numeric": true
      }
    }
  }
}
----

Whilst NEST can _serialize_ our `my_plugin_property`, it does not know how to _deserialize_ it;
We plan to make this more pluggable in the future.
