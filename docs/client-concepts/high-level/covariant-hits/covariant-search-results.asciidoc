[[covariant-search-results]]
=== Covariant search results

NEST used to have a feature that allowed you to map multiple types in an index back into a covariant list.

Since types are removed in Elasticsearch 6.0 this feature is no longer supported. Because you can
now explicitly inject a serializer for user types only (_source, fields etcetera) please rely on a JsonConverter that
can do this out of the box e.g `TypeNameHandling.All` from `Json.NET`
