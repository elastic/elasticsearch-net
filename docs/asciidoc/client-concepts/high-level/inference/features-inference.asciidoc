== Features Inference

Some URIs in Elasticsearch take a `Feature` enum.
Within NEST, route values on the URI are represented as classes that implement an interface, `IUrlParameter`.
Since enums _cannot_ implement interfaces in C#, a route parameter that would be of type `Feature` is represented using the `Features` class that
the `Feature` enum implicitly converts to.

=== Constructor

Using the `Features` constructor directly is possible but rather involved 

[source,csharp]
----
Features fieldString = Feature.Mappings | Feature.Aliases;
Expect("_mappings,_aliases")
    .WhenSerializing(fieldString);
----

=== Implicit conversion

Here we instantiate a GET index request whichs takes two features, settings and warmers.
Notice how we can use the `Feature` enum directly.

[source,csharp]
----
var request = new GetIndexRequest(All, Feature.Settings | Feature.Warmers);
----
