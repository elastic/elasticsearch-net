[[full-text-queries]]
== Full text queries 

The high-level full text queries are usually used for running full text queries on full text fields like the body of an email. 
They understand how the field being queried is analyzed and will apply each field’s analyzer (or `search_analyzer`) to the query string before executing.

[[term-level-queries]]
== Term level queries

While the <<full-text-queries, full text queries>> will analyze the query string before executing, the term-level queries operate on the exact terms 
that are stored in the inverted index.

These queries are usually used for structured data like numbers, dates, and enums, rather than full text fields. 
Alternatively, they allow you to craft low-level queries, foregoing the analysis process.

[[compound-queries]]
== Compound queries

Compound queries wrap other compound or leaf queries, either to combine their results and scores, 
to change their behaviour, or to switch from query to filter context.

NEST exposes all of the term queries available in Elasticsearch

:anchor-list: query-dsl/compound

* <<bool-dsl-complex-query-usage,Bool Dsl Complex Query Usage>>

[[joining-queries]]
== Joining queries

Performing full SQL-style joins in a distributed system like Elasticsearch is prohibitively expensive. 
Instead, Elasticsearch offers two forms of join which are designed to scale horizontally.

:anchor-list: query-dsl/joining

* <<has-child-query-usage,Has Child Query Usage>>

* <<has-parent-query-usage,Has Parent Query Usage>>

* <<nested-query-usage,Nested Query Usage>>

* <<parent-id-query-usage,Parent Id Query Usage>>

See the Elasticsearch documentation on {ref_current}/joining-queries.html[Joining queries] for more details.

include::query-dsl/joining/has-parent/has-parent-query-usage.asciidoc[]

include::query-dsl/joining/nested/nested-query-usage.asciidoc[]

include::query-dsl/joining/parent-id/parent-id-query-usage.asciidoc[]

[[geo-queries]]
== Geo queries

Elasticsearch supports many different types of geospatial queries, operating on {ref_current}/geo-point.html[geo_point] fields 
which support lat/lon pairs, and {ref_current}/geo-shape.html[geo_shape] fields, which support points, lines, circles, polygons, multi-polygons etc.

:anchor-list: query-dsl/geo

* <<geo-bounding-box-query-usage,Geo Bounding Box Query Usage>>

* <<geo-distance-query-usage,Geo Distance Query Usage>>

* <<geo-shape-query-usage,Geo Shape Query Usage>>

* <<geo-polygon-query-usage,Geo Polygon Query Usage>>

See the Elasticsearch documentation on {ref_current}/geo-queries.html[Geo queries] for more details.

[[specialized-queries]]
== Specialized queries

Specialized types of queries that do not fit into other groups

:anchor-list: query-dsl/specialized

* <<distance-feature-query-usage,Distance Feature Query Usage>>

* <<more-like-this-full-document-query-usage,More Like This Full Document Query Usage>>

[[span-queries]]
== Span queries

Span queries are low-level positional queries which provide expert control over the order and proximity of the specified terms. 
These are typically used to implement very specific queries on legal documents or patents.

Span queries cannot be mixed with non-span queries (with the exception of the span_multi query).

:anchor-list: query-dsl/span

* <<span-containing-query-usage,Span Containing Query Usage>>

* <<span-field-masking-usage,Span Field Masking Usage>>

* <<span-near-query-usage,Span Near Query Usage>>

* <<span-not-query-usage,Span Not Query Usage>>

* <<span-or-query-usage,Span Or Query Usage>>

* <<span-term-query-usage,Span Term Query Usage>>
