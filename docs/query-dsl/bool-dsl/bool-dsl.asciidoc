[[bool-queries]]
=== Writing bool queries

Writing `bool` queries can grow verbose rather quickly when using the query DSL. For example,
take a single {ref_current}/query-dsl-bool-query.html[bool query] with two `should` clauses

[source,csharp]
----
var searchResults = this.Client.Search<Project>(s => s
    .Query(q => q
        .Bool(b => b
            .Should(
                bs => bs.Term(p => p.Name, "x"),
                bs => bs.Term(p => p.Name, "y")
            )
        )
    )
);
----

Now, imagine multiple nested `bool` queries; you'll realise that this quickly becomes an exercise
in __hadouken indenting__

[float]
=== Operator overloading

For this reason, NEST introduces **operator overloading** so complex `bool` queries become easier to write.
The overloaded operators are

* <<binary-or-operator, Binary `||` operator>>

* <<binary-and-operator, Binary `&&` operator>>

* <<unary-negation-operator, Unary `!` operator>>

* <<unary-plus-operator, Unary `+` operator>>

We'll demonstrate each with examples.

[[binary-or-operator]]
==== Binary || operator

Using the overloaded binary `||` operator, a `bool` query with `should` clauses can be more succinctly
expressed.

The previous example now becomes the following with the Fluent API

[source,csharp]
----
var firstSearchResponse = client.Search<Project>(s => s
    .Query(q => q
        .Term(p => p.Name, "x") || q
        .Term(p => p.Name, "y")
    )
);
----

and, with the the Object Initializer syntax 

[source,csharp]
----
var secondSearchResponse = client.Search<Project>(new SearchRequest<Project>
{
    Query = new TermQuery { Field = Field<Project>(p => p.Name), Value = "x" } ||
            new TermQuery { Field = Field<Project>(p => p.Name), Value = "y" }
});
----

Both result in the following JSON query DSL

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "should": [
        {
          "term": {
            "name": {
              "value": "x"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "term": {
            "name": {
              "value": "y"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

[[binary-and-operator]]
==== Binary && operator

The overloaded binary `&&` operator can be used to combine queries together. When the queries to be combined
don't have any unary operators applied to them, the resulting query is a `bool` query with `must` clauses

[source,csharp]
----
var firstSearchResponse = client.Search<Project>(s => s
    .Query(q => q
        .Term(p => p.Name, "x") && q
        .Term(p => p.Name, "y")
    )
);
----

and, with the the Object Initializer syntax 

[source,csharp]
----
var secondSearchResponse = client.Search<Project>(new SearchRequest<Project>
{
    Query = new TermQuery { Field = Field<Project>(p => p.Name), Value = "x" } &&
            new TermQuery { Field = Field<Project>(p => p.Name), Value = "y" }
});
----

Both result in the following JSON query DSL

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "term": {
            "name": {
              "value": "x"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "term": {
            "name": {
              "value": "y"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

A naive implementation of operator overloading would rewrite

[source,sh]
----
term && term && term
----

to

....
bool
|___must
   |___term
   |___bool
       |___must
           |___term
           |___term
....

As you can imagine this becomes unwieldy quite fast, the more complex a query becomes. NEST is smart enough
to join the `&&` queries together to form a single `bool` query

....
bool
|___must
   |___term
   |___term
   |___term
....

as demonstrated with the following

[source,csharp]
----
Assert(
    q => q.Query() && q.Query() && q.Query(), <1>
    Query && Query && Query, <2>
    c => c.Bool.Must.Should().HaveCount(3) <3>
);
----
<1> three queries `&&` together using the Fluent API
<2> three queries `&&` together using Object Initialzer syntax
<3> assert the resulting `bool` query in each case has 3 `must` clauses

[[unary-negation-operator]]
==== Unary ! operator

NEST also offers a shorthand notation for creating a `bool` query with a `must_not` clause
using the unary `!` operator

[source,csharp]
----
var firstSearchResponse = client.Search<Project>(s => s
    .Query(q => !q
        .Term(p => p.Name, "x")
    )
);
----

and, with the Object Initializer syntax 

[source,csharp]
----
var secondSearchResponse = client.Search<Project>(new SearchRequest<Project>
{
    Query = !new TermQuery { Field = Field<Project>(p => p.Name), Value = "x" }
});
----

Both result in the following JSON query DSL

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must_not": [
        {
          "term": {
            "name": {
              "value": "x"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

Two queries marked with the unary `!`  operator can be combined with the `&&` operator to form
a single `bool` query with two `must_not` clauses

[source,csharp]
----
Assert(
    q => !q.Query() && !q.Query(), <1>
    !Query && !Query, <2>
    c => c.Bool.MustNot.Should().HaveCount(2)); <3>
----
<1> two queries with `!` operator applied, `&&` together using the Fluent API
<2> two queries with `!` operator applied, `&&` together using the Object Initializer syntax
<3> assert the resulting `bool` query in each case has two `must_not` clauses

[[unary-plus-operator]]
==== Unary + operator

A query can be transformed into a `bool` query with a `filter` clause using the unary `+` operator

[source,csharp]
----
var firstSearchResponse = client.Search<Project>(s => s
    .Query(q => +q
        .Term(p => p.Name, "x")
    )
);
----

and, with the Object Initializer syntax 

[source,csharp]
----
var secondSearchResponse = client.Search<Project>(new SearchRequest<Project>
{
    Query = +new TermQuery { Field = Field<Project>(p => p.Name), Value = "x" }
});
----

Both result in the following JSON query DSL

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "filter": [
        {
          "term": {
            "name": {
              "value": "x"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
----

This runs the {ref_current}/query-filter-context.html[query in a filter context],
which can be useful in improving performance where the relevancy score for the query
is not required to affect the order of results.

Similarly to the unary `!` operator, queries marked with the unary `+`  operator can be
combined with the `&&` operator to form a single `bool` query with two `filter` clauses

[source,csharp]
----
Assert(
    q => +q.Query() && +q.Query(),
    +Query && +Query,
    c => c.Bool.Filter.Should().HaveCount(2));
----

[float]
=== Combining bool queries

When combining multiple queries with the binary `&&` operator
where some or all queries have unary operators applied,
NEST is still able to combine them to form a single `bool` query.

Take for example the following `bool` query

....
bool
|___must
|   |___term
|   |___term
|   |___term
|
|___must_not
   |___term
....

This can be constructed with NEST using

[source,csharp]
----
Assert(
    q => q.Query() && q.Query() && q.Query() && !q.Query(),
    Query && Query && Query && !Query,
    c=>
    {
        c.Bool.Must.Should().HaveCount(3);
        c.Bool.MustNot.Should().HaveCount(1);
    });
----

An even more complex example

[source,sh]
----
term && term && term && !term && +term && +term
----

still only results in a single `bool` query with the following structure

....
bool
|___must
|   |___term
|   |___term
|   |___term
|
|___must_not
|   |___term
|
|___filter
   |___term
   |___term
....

[source,csharp]
----
Assert(
    q => q.Query() && q.Query() && q.Query() && !q.Query() && +q.Query() && +q.Query(),
    Query && Query && Query && !Query && +Query && +Query,
    c =>
    {
        c.Bool.Must.Should().HaveCount(3);
        c.Bool.MustNot.Should().HaveCount(1);
        c.Bool.Filter.Should().HaveCount(2);
    });
----

You can still mix and match actual `bool` queries with operator overloaded queries e.g

[source,sh]
----
bool(must=term, term, term) && !term
----

This will still merge into a single `bool` query.

[source,csharp]
----
Assert(
    q => q.Bool(b => b.Must(mq => mq.Query(), mq => mq.Query(), mq => mq.Query())) && !q.Query(),
    new BoolQuery { Must = new QueryContainer[] { Query, Query, Query } } && !Query,
    c =>
    {
        c.Bool.Must.Should().HaveCount(3);
        c.Bool.MustNot.Should().HaveCount(1);
    });
----

==== Combining queries with || or should clauses

As per the previous example, NEST will combine multiple `should` or `||` into a single `bool` query
with `should` clauses, when it sees that the `bool` queries in play **only** consist of `should` clauses;

To summarize, this

[source,sh]
----
term || term || term
----

becomes

....
bool
|___should
   |___term
   |___term
   |___term
....

However, the `bool` query does not quite follow the same boolean logic you expect from a
programming language. That is

[source,sh]
----
term1 && (term2 || term3 || term4)
----

does **not** become

....
bool
|___must
|   |___term1
|
|___should
   |___term2
   |___term3
   |___term4
....

Why is this? Well, when a `bool` query has **only** `should` clauses, **__at least one__** of them must match.
However, when that `bool` query also has a `must` clause, the `should` clauses instead now act as a
_boost_ factor, meaning none of them have to match but if they do, the relevancy score for that document
will be boosted and thus appear higher in the results. The semantics for how `should` clauses behave then
changes based on the presence of the `must` clause.

So, relating this back to the previous example, you could get back results that **only** contain `term1`.
This is clearly not what was intended when using operator overloading.

To aid with this, NEST rewrites the previous query as

....
bool
|___must
   |___term1
   |___bool
       |___should
           |___term2
           |___term3
           |___term4
....

[source,csharp]
----
Assert(
    q => q.Query() && (q.Query() || q.Query() || q.Query()),
    Query && (Query || Query || Query),
    c =>
    {
        c.Bool.Must.Should().HaveCount(2);
        var lastMustClause = (IQueryContainer)c.Bool.Must.Last();
        lastMustClause.Should().NotBeNull();
        lastMustClause.Bool.Should().NotBeNull();
        lastMustClause.Bool.Should.Should().HaveCount(3);
    });
----

TIP: *Add parentheses to force evaluation order*

Using `should` clauses as boost factors can be a really powerful construct when building
search queries, and remember, you can mix and match an actual `bool` query with NEST's operator overloading.

There is another subtle situation where NEST will not blindly merge two `bool` queries with only
`should` clauses. Consider the following

[source,sh]
----
bool(should=term1, term2, term3, term4, minimum_should_match=2) || term5 || term6
----

if NEST identified both sides of a binary `||` operation as only containing `should` clauses and
joined them together, it would give a different meaning to the `minimum_should_match` parameter of
the first `bool` query; rewriting this to a single `bool` with 5 `should` clauses would break the semantics
of the original query because only matching on `term5` or `term6` should still be a hit.

[source,csharp]
----
Assert(
    q => q.Bool(b => b
        .Should(mq => mq.Query(), mq => mq.Query(), mq => mq.Query(), mq => mq.Query())
        .MinimumShouldMatch(2)
        )
         || !q.Query() || q.Query(),
    new BoolQuery
    {
        Should = new QueryContainer[] { Query, Query, Query, Query },
        MinimumShouldMatch = 2
    } || !Query || Query,
    c =>
    {
        c.Bool.Should.Should().HaveCount(3);
        var nestedBool = c.Bool.Should.First() as IQueryContainer;
        nestedBool.Bool.Should.Should().HaveCount(4);
    });
----

[float]
=== Locked bool queries

NEST will not combine `bool` queries if any of the query metadata is set e.g if metadata such as `boost` or `name` are set,
NEST will treat these as locked.

Here we demonstrate that two locked `bool` queries are not combined

[source,csharp]
----
Assert(
    q => q.Bool(b => b.Name("leftBool").Should(mq => mq.Query()))
         || q.Bool(b => b.Name("rightBool").Should(mq => mq.Query())),
    new BoolQuery { Name = "leftBool", Should = new QueryContainer[] { Query } }
    || new BoolQuery { Name = "rightBool", Should = new QueryContainer[] { Query } },
    c => AssertDoesNotJoinOntoLockedBool(c, "leftBool"));
----

neither are two `bool` queries where either right query is locked 

[source,csharp]
----
Assert(
    q => q.Bool(b => b.Should(mq => mq.Query()))
         || q.Bool(b => b.Name("rightBool").Should(mq => mq.Query())),
    new BoolQuery { Should = new QueryContainer[] { Query } }
    || new BoolQuery { Name = "rightBool", Should = new QueryContainer[] { Query } },
    c => AssertDoesNotJoinOntoLockedBool(c, "rightBool"));
----

or the left query is locked 

[source,csharp]
----
Assert(
    q => q.Bool(b => b.Name("leftBool").Should(mq => mq.Query()))
         || q.Bool(b => b.Should(mq => mq.Query())),
    new BoolQuery { Name = "leftBool", Should = new QueryContainer[] { Query } }
    || new BoolQuery { Should = new QueryContainer[] { Query } },
    c => AssertDoesNotJoinOntoLockedBool(c, "leftBool"));
----

[float]
=== Perfomance considerations

If you have a requirement of combining many many queries using the bool dsl please take the following into account.

You *can* use bitwise assignments in a loop to combine many queries into a bigger bool.

In this example we are creating a single bool query with a 1000 must clauses using the `&=` assign operator.

[source,csharp]
----
var c = new QueryContainer();
var q = new TermQuery { Field = "x", Value = "x" };

for (var i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
{
    c &= q;
}
----

....
|     Median|     StdDev|       Gen 0|  Gen 1|  Gen 2|  Bytes Allocated/Op
|  1.8507 ms|  0.1878 ms|    1,793.00|  21.00|      -|        1.872.672,28
....

As you can see while still fast its causes a lot of allocations to happen because with each iteration
we need to re evaluate the mergability of our bool query.

Since we already know the shape of our bool query in advance its much much faster to do this instead:

[source,csharp]
----
QueryContainer q = new TermQuery { Field = "x", Value = "x" };
var x = Enumerable.Range(0, 1000).Select(f => q).ToArray();
var boolQuery = new BoolQuery
{
    Must = x
};
----

....
|      Median|     StdDev|   Gen 0|  Gen 1|  Gen 2|  Bytes Allocated/Op
|  31.4610 us|  0.9495 us|  439.00|      -|      -|            7.912,95
....

The drop both in performance and allocations is tremendous!

[NOTE]
====
If you assigning many `bool` queries prior to NEST 2.4.6 into a bigger `bool` query using an assignment loop,
the client did not do a good job of flattening the result in the most optimal way and could
cause a stackoverflow when doing ~2000 iterations. This only applied to bitwise assigning many `bool` queries,
other queries were not affected.

Since NEST 2.4.6 you can combine as many bool queries as you'd like this way too.
See https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-net/pull/2235[PR #2335 on github for more information]
