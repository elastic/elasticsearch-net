[[pinned-query-usage]]
=== Pinned Query Usage

Promotes selected documents to rank higher than those matching a given query. This feature is typically used to
guide searchers to curated documents that are promoted over and above any "organic" matches for a search. The promoted or "pinned"
documents are identified using the document IDs stored in the _id field.
See the Elasticsearch documentation on {ref_current}/query-dsl-pinned-query.html[pinned query] for more details.

==== Fluent DSL example

[source,csharp]
----
q
.Pinned(c => c
    .Name("named_query")
    .Boost(1.1)
    .Organic(qq => qq.MatchAll(m => m.Name("organic_query")))
    .Ids(1, 11, 22)
)
----

==== Object Initializer syntax example

[source,csharp]
----
new PinnedQuery()
{
    Name = "named_query",
    Boost = 1.1,
    Organic = new MatchAllQuery { Name = "organic_query" },
    Ids = new Id[] { 1,11,22 },
}
