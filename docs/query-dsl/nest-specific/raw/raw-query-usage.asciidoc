=== Raw Query Usage

Allows a query represented as a string of JSON to be passed to NEST's Fluent API or Object Initializer syntax.
This can be useful when porting over a query expressed in the query DSL over to NEST.

==== Fluent DSL example

[source,csharp]
----
q
.Raw(RawTermQuery)
----

==== Object Initializer syntax example

[source,csharp]
----
new RawQuery(RawTermQuery)
----

[source,javascript]
.Example json output
----
{
  "term": {
    "fieldname": "value"
  }
}
