== Installation

This page shows you how to install the .NET client for {es}.

IMPORTANT: The v8 client for .NET does not have complete feature parity with 
the v7 `NEST` client. It may not be suitable for for all applications until 
additional endpoints and features are supported. We therefore recommend you thoroughly review our <<release-notes-8.0.0,release notes>> before attempting to migrate existing applications to the `Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch` library. Until the new client supports all endpoints and features your application requires, 
you may continue to use the 7.17.x release of the client to communicate with v8 
Elasticsearch servers using compatibility mode. Refer to the 
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/net-api/7.17/connecting-to-elasticsearch-v8.html[Connecting to Elasticsearch v8.x using the v7.17.x client documentation] for guidance on configuring the 7.17.x client.

=== Installing the .NET client

For SDK style projects, you can install the {es} client by running the following 
.NET CLI command in your terminal:

[source,text]
----
dotnet add package Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch
----

This command adds a package reference to your project (csproj) file for the 
latest stable version of the client.

If you prefer, you may also manually add a package reference inside your project 
file:

[source,shell]
----
<PackageReference Include="Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch" Version="8.0.0" />
----
_NOTE: The version number should reflect the latest published version from 
https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch[NuGet.org]. To install a different version, modify the version as necessary._

For Visual Studio users, the .NET client can also be installed from the Package
Manager Console inside Visual Studio using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
Install-Package Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch
----

Alternatively, search for `Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch` in the NuGet Package 
Manager UI.

To learn how to connect the {es} client, refer to the <<connecting,Connecting>> section.

[[compatibility]]
=== Compatibility

The {es} client is compatible with currently maintained .NET runtime versions. 
Compatibility with End of Life (EOL) .NET runtimes is not guaranteed or supported.

Language clients are forward compatible; meaning that clients support 
communicating with greater or equal minor versions of {es}. {es} language 
clients are only backward compatible with default distributions and without 
guarantees made.

Refer to the https://www.elastic.co/support/eol[end-of-life policy] for more 
information.
