== Introduction

This is the documentation page for `Elasticsearch.Net` and `NEST`, the two 
official .NET clients for {es}.

[discrete]
=== Why two clients?

`Elasticsearch.Net` is a low level, dependency free client that has no opinions 
about how you build and represent your requests and responses. It has abstracted 
enough so that **all** the {es} API endpoints are represented as methods but not 
too much to get in the way of how you want to build your json/request/response 
objects. It also comes with built in, configurable/overridable cluster failover 
retry mechanisms. {es} is _elastic_ so why not your client?

`NEST` is a high level client that maps all requests and responses as types, and 
comes with a strongly typed query DSL that maps 1 to 1 with the {es} query DSL. 
It takes advantage of specific .NET features to provide higher level 
abstractions such as <<auto-map, auto mapping of CLR types>>. Internally, NEST 
uses and still exposes the low level `Elasticsearch.Net` client, providing 
access to the power of NEST and allowing users to drop down to the low level 
client when wishing to.

Please read the getting started guide for both 
<<elasticsearch-net,Elasticsearch.Net>> and <<nest,NEST>>.

=== {es} Version Compatibility

Language clients are forward compatible; meaning that clients support communicating with greater or equal minor versions of {es}.
{es} language clients are only backwards compatible with default distributions and without guarantees made.

=== Questions, bugs, comments, feature requests

Bug reports and feature requests are more than welcome on the 
{github}/issues[github issues pages]! We try to at least reply within the same 
day.

For more general questions and comments, we monitor questions tagged with 
{stackoverflow}/questions/tagged/nest[`nest`] and 
{stackoverflow}/questions/tagged/elasticsearch-net[`elasticsearch-net`] on 
Stackoverflow, as well as discussions opened on our Discourse site, 
https://discuss.elastic.co/c/elasticsearch[discuss.elastic.co]. By mentioning 
`NEST` or `Elasticsearch.Net` in the title helps folks quickly identify what 
the question is about.
