== Getting started

This page guides you through the installation process of the .NET client, shows 
you how to instantiate the client, and how to perform basic Elasticsearch 
operations with it.

[discrete]
=== Requirements

* .NET Core, .NET 5+ or .NET Framework (4.6.1 and higher).

[discrete]
=== Installation 

To install the latest version of the client for SDK style projects, run the following command:

[source,shell]
--------------------------
dotnet add package Elastic.Clients.Elasticsearch
--------------------------

Refer to the <<installation>> page to learn more.

=== Connecting

You can connect to the Elastic Cloud using an API key and the Elasticsearch 
endpoint. 

[source,net]
----
var client = new ElasticsearchClient("<CLOUD_ID>", new ApiKey("<API_KEY>")); 
----

Your Elasticsearch endpoint can be found on the **My deployment** page of your 
deployment:

You can generate an API key on the **Management** page under Security.

For other connection options, refer to the <<connecting>> section.


[discrete]
=== Operations

Time to use Elasticsearch! This section walks you through the basic, and most 
important, operations of Elasticsearch. For more operations and more advanced 
examples, refer to the <<examples>> page.


[discrete]
==== Creating an index

This is how you create the `my_index` index:

[source,net]
----
var response = await client.Indices.CreateAsync("my_index");
----


[discrete]
==== Indexing documents

This is a simple way of indexing a document:

[source,net]
----
var doc = new MyDoc
{
    Id = 1,
    User = "flobernd",
    Message = "Trying out the client, so far so good?"
};

var response = await client.IndexAsync(doc, "my_index"); 
----


[discrete]
==== Getting documents

You can get documents by using the following code:

[source,net]
----
var response = await client.GetAsync<MyDoc>(id, idx => idx.Index("my_index"));

if (response.IsValidResponse) 
{
    var doc = response.Source;
}
----


[discrete]
==== Searching documents

This is how you can create a single match query with the .NET client: 

[source,net]
----
var response = await client.SearchAsync<MyDoc>(s => s 
    .Index("my_index") 
    .From(0)
    .Size(10)
    .Query(q => q
        .Term(t => t.User, "flobernd") 
    )
);

if (response.IsValidResponse)
{
    var doc = response.Documents.FirstOrDefault(); 
}
----


[discrete]
==== Updating documents

This is how you can update a document, for example to add a new field:

[source,net]
----
doc.Message = "This is a new message"; 

var response = await client.UpdateAsync<MyDoc, MyDoc>("my_index", 1, u => u
    .Doc(doc)); 
----


[discrete]
==== Deleting documents

[source,net]
----
var response = await client.DeleteAsync("my_index", 1);
----


[discrete]
==== Deleting an index

[source,net]
----
var response = await client.Indices.DeleteAsync("my_index");
----
