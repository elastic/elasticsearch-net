[[logging]]
== Logging

Whilst developing with Elasticsearch using NEST, it can be extremely valuable to see the requests that
NEST generates and sends to Elasticsearch, as well as the responses returned.

There are a couple of popular ways of capturing this information

* <<logging-with-on-request-completed, Using `OnRequestCompleted`>>

* <<logging-with-fiddler, Using Fiddler>>

[[debugging]]
== Debugging

When things are going awry, you want to be provided with as much information as possible, to resolve
the issue!

Elasticsearch.Net and NEST provide an <<audit-trail, audit trail>> and <<debug-information, debug information>> to 
help get you back on the happy path.
