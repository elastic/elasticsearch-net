# Using the .NET Client [usage]

The sections below provide tutorials on the most frequently used and some less obvious features of {{es}}.

For a full reference, see the [Elasticsearch documentation](docs-content://get-started/index.md) and in particular the [REST APIs](elasticsearch://docs/reference/elasticsearch/rest-apis/index.md) section. The Elasticsearch .NET Client follows closely the JSON structures described there.

A .NET API reference documentation for the Elasticsearch client package is available [here](https://elastic.github.io/elasticsearch-net).

If you’re new to {{es}}, make sure also to read [Elasticsearch’s quick start](docs-content://solutions/search/get-started.md) that provides a good introduction.

This is still a work in progress, more sections will be added in the near future.
