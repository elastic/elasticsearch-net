/// <para>
/// For example, suppose you have a cluster of three nodes, A, B, and C and you create an index index with the number of replicas set to 3 (resulting in 4 shard copies, one more copy than there are nodes).
/// If you attempt an indexing operation, by default the operation will only ensure the primary copy of each shard is available before proceeding.
/// This means that even if B and C went down and A hosted the primary shard copies, the indexing operation would still proceed with only one copy of the data.
/// If <c>wait_for_active_shards</c> is set on the request to <c>3</c> (and all three nodes are up), the indexing operation will require 3 active shard copies before proceeding.
/// This requirement should be met because there are 3 active nodes in the cluster, each one holding a copy of the shard.
/// However, if you set <c>wait_for_active_shards</c> to <c>all</c> (or to <c>4</c>, which is the same in this situation), the indexing operation will not proceed as you do not have all 4 copies of each shard active in the index.
/// The operation will timeout unless a new node is brought up in the cluster to host the fourth copy of the shard.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// It is important to note that this setting greatly reduces the chances of the write operation not writing to the requisite number of shard copies, but it does not completely eliminate the possibility, because this check occurs before the write operation starts.
/// After the write operation is underway, it is still possible for replication to fail on any number of shard copies but still succeed on the primary.
/// The <c>_shards</c> section of the API response reveals the number of shard copies on which replication succeeded and failed.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>No operation (noop) updates</strong>
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// When updating a document by using this API, a new version of the document is always created even if the document hasn't changed.
/// If this isn't acceptable use the <c>_update</c> API with <c>detect_noop</c> set to <c>true</c>.
/// The <c>detect_noop</c> option isn't available on this API because it doesn’t fetch the old source and isn't able to compare it against the new source.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// There isn't a definitive rule for when noop updates aren't acceptable.
/// It's a combination of lots of factors like how frequently your data source sends updates that are actually noops and how many queries per second Elasticsearch runs on the shard receiving the updates.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Versioning</strong>
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Each indexed document is given a version number.
/// By default, internal versioning is used that starts at 1 and increments with each update, deletes included.
/// Optionally, the version number can be set to an external value (for example, if maintained in a database).
/// To enable this functionality, <c>version_type</c> should be set to <c>external</c>.
/// The value provided must be a numeric, long value greater than or equal to 0, and less than around <c>9.2e+18</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// NOTE: Versioning is completely real time, and is not affected by the near real time aspects of search operations.
/// If no version is provided, the operation runs without any version checks.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// When using the external version type, the system checks to see if the version number passed to the index request is greater than the version of the currently stored document.
/// If true, the document will be indexed and the new version number used.
/// If the value provided is less than or equal to the stored document's version number, a version conflict will occur and the index operation will fail. For example:
/// </para>
/// <code>
/// PUT my-index-000001/_doc/1?version=2&amp;version_type=external
/// {
///   "user": {
///     "id": "elkbee"
///   }
/// }
/// 
/// In this example, the operation will succeed since the supplied version of 2 is higher than the current document version of 1.
/// If the document was already updated and its version was set to 2 or higher, the indexing command will fail and result in a conflict (409 HTTP status code).
/// 
/// A nice side effect is that there is no need to maintain strict ordering of async indexing operations run as a result of changes to a source database, as long as version numbers from the source database are used.
/// Even the simple case of updating the Elasticsearch index using data from a database is simplified if external versioning is used, as only the latest version will be used if the index operations arrive out of order.

/// </para>
/// <para>
/// To improve the resiliency of writes to the system, indexing operations can be configured to wait for a certain number of active shard copies before proceeding with the operation.
/// If the requisite number of active shard copies are not available, then the write operation must wait and retry, until either the requisite shard copies have started or a timeout occurs.
/// By default, write operations only wait for the primary shards to be active before proceeding (that is to say <c>wait_for_active_shards</c> is <c>1</c>).
/// This default can be overridden in the index settings dynamically by setting <c>index.write.wait_for_active_shards</c>.
/// To alter this behavior per operation, use the <c>wait_for_active_shards request</c> parameter.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Valid values are all or any positive integer up to the total number of configured copies per shard in the index (which is <c>number_of_replicas</c>+1).
/// Specifying a negative value or a number greater than the number of shard copies will throw an error.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// For example, suppose you have a cluster of three nodes, A, B, and C and you create an index index with the number of replicas set to 3 (resulting in 4 shard copies, one more copy than there are nodes).
/// If you attempt an indexing operation, by default the operation will only ensure the primary copy of each shard is available before proceeding.
/// This means that even if B and C went down and A hosted the primary shard copies, the indexing operation would still proceed with only one copy of the data.
/// If <c>wait_for_active_shards</c> is set on the request to <c>3</c> (and all three nodes are up), the indexing operation will require 3 active shard copies before proceeding.
/// This requirement should be met because there are 3 active nodes in the cluster, each one holding a copy of the shard.
/// However, if you set <c>wait_for_active_shards</c> to <c>all</c> (or to <c>4</c>, which is the same in this situation), the indexing operation will not proceed as you do not have all 4 copies of each shard active in the index.
/// The operation will timeout unless a new node is brought up in the cluster to host the fourth copy of the shard.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// It is important to note that this setting greatly reduces the chances of the write operation not writing to the requisite number of shard copies, but it does not completely eliminate the possibility, because this check occurs before the write operation starts.
/// After the write operation is underway, it is still possible for replication to fail on any number of shard copies but still succeed on the primary.
/// The <c>_shards</c> section of the API response reveals the number of shard copies on which replication succeeded and failed.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>No operation (noop) updates</strong>
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// When updating a document by using this API, a new version of the document is always created even if the document hasn't changed.
/// If this isn't acceptable use the <c>_update</c> API with <c>detect_noop</c> set to <c>true</c>.
/// The <c>detect_noop</c> option isn't available on this API because it doesn’t fetch the old source and isn't able to compare it against the new source.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// There isn't a definitive rule for when noop updates aren't acceptable.
/// It's a combination of lots of factors like how frequently your data source sends updates that are actually noops and how many queries per second Elasticsearch runs on the shard receiving the updates.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Versioning</strong>
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Each indexed document is given a version number.
/// By default, internal versioning is used that starts at 1 and increments with each update, deletes included.
/// Optionally, the version number can be set to an external value (for example, if maintained in a database).
/// To enable this functionality, <c>version_type</c> should be set to <c>external</c>.
/// The value provided must be a numeric, long value greater than or equal to 0, and less than around <c>9.2e+18</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// NOTE: Versioning is completely real time, and is not affected by the near real time aspects of search operations.
/// If no version is provided, the operation runs without any version checks.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// When using the external version type, the system checks to see if the version number passed to the index request is greater than the version of the currently stored document.
/// If true, the document will be indexed and the new version number used.
/// If the value provided is less than or equal to the stored document's version number, a version conflict will occur and the index operation will fail. For example:
/// </para>
/// <code>
/// PUT my-index-000001/_doc/1?version=2&amp;version_type=external
/// {
///   "user": {
///     "id": "elkbee"
///   }
/// }
/// 
/// In this example, the operation will succeed since the supplied version of 2 is higher than the current document version of 1.
/// If the document was already updated and its version was set to 2 or higher, the indexing command will fail and result in a conflict (409 HTTP status code).
/// 
/// A nice side effect is that there is no need to maintain strict ordering of async indexing operations run as a result of changes to a source database, as long as version numbers from the source database are used.
/// Even the simple case of updating the Elasticsearch index using data from a database is simplified if external versioning is used, as only the latest version will be used if the index operations arrive out of order.
/// </code>
